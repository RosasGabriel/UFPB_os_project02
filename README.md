# Final project for the discipline of Operational Systems

The project consists of the implementation of three paging algorithms:\
->First In First Out (FIFO);\
->Optimal Paging Algorithm (OTM);\
->Least Recently Used (LRU);

The expected output is the acronym for each algorithm and it's number of page faults.

The detailed description for the project can be found in the trabalho02.pdf file.
